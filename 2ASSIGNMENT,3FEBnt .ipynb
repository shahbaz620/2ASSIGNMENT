    "Q2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs\n",

    "Ans:-*args and **kwargs are used in Python functions to handle variable numbers of arguments.\n",
    "*args: This is used to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. The args parameter allows you to pass any number of arguments to a function, and they will be wrapped up in a tuple.\n",
    "**kwargs: This is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. The kwargs parameter allows you to pass any number of keyword arguments to a function, and they will be wrapped up in a dictionary.\n",
